Welcome to the summer term workshop on music computing with SonicPi.

# Purpose of the Course

This course builds on the concepts presented in ‘Theoretical Background of Audio and Graphics’ and introduces the software development toolkit ‘SonicPi’ for music computing. We will start with an exploration of the SonicPi IDE and its programming language Ruby. Then we will look into the relevant audio programming concepts that SonicPi implements as well as the musical concepts and capabilites for live music making supported by the toolkit. In this context, we will also look into the different musical genres that can be created using SonicPi. Last but not least we will explore different application scenarios for music computing and live music coding.

# Specific Objectives
- Getting to know the concept of music computing with SonicPi in Ruby
- Creating an individual piece of music through programming


# Resources

- Given during the workshop.
- We will use GitHub to exchange course materials.
- All participants are required to download SonicPi at https://sonic-pi.net
