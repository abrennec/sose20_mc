# Purpose of the Course

This course builds on the concepts presented in ‘Theoretical Background of Audio and Graphics’ and introduces the software development toolkit ‘SonicPi’ for music computing. We will start with an exploration of the SonicPi IDE and its programming language Ruby. Then we will look into the relevant audio programming concepts that SonicPi implements as well as the musical concepts and capabilites for live music making supported by the toolkit. In this context, we will also look into the different musical genres that can be created using SonicPi. Last but not least we will explore different application scenarios for music computing and live music coding.

## Objectives

- Getting to know the concept of music computing with SonicPi 
- Understanding music theory and how it is picked up computationally
- Understanding the difference between music and sound / synths
- Creating an individual piece of music through programming
- Understanding the basic software components of Sonic Pi that build on SuperCollider 
- Getting an introduction into composition

## Resources

We will use Github to share communications and materials. For this course, you will need monitor speakers or headphones. Please also  download the following software package and documentation:

- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- [Sonic Pi Tutorial (the documentation that comes with the software)](https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial.html)
