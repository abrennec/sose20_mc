## Hearing Damage

If the sound waves that hit your ear drum are too loud, your inner ear and in particular the hair cells of the cochlea, can be damaged. The following images show functioning and damaged hair cells.

Apart from the hair cells, loud noise that is too loud can also damage your ear drum and ossicles. Therefore, please turn down the volume and be very careful of your ears!
