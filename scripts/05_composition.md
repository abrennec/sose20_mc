# Composition 


Now that you know about the most fundamental aspects of music computing with Sonic Pi, you can spend the rest of the time with two more free style tasks that address music and/or soundscape composition.

## Final Exercise 1

Pick a visual scene, this can be still images from a movie your like, paintings, personal images, images that you just now take inside of your flat or whatsoever. This scene will form the basis for your composition. Now take the time to regard and contemplate the images. Jot down a few words that come to your mind that describe the general mood the images trigger. Maybe you have an association to music or sound right away. Try to note down what comes to your mind and what you would like to create musically / sound-wise.

Based on your ideas, start to draft a first patch with Sonic Pi. Exchange your thoughts, images and first draft with the group and continue working on the song or song ideas. You do not have to come up with a final song. You might as well create different sonic aspects if that suits your approach/concept better.

## Final Exercise 2 

If the final exercise 1 does not appeal to you, come up with an own idea for the final exercise with Sonic Pi.
