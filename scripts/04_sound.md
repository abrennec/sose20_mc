# Tweaking Sounds
   1) Sound Parameters
   2) Synths and Samples
   3) FX

Let us start with a few music examples:

- [David August](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwL_CIhS9Qs)
- [Christian LÃ¶ffler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OijrlItssOc)
- [Alfa Mist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVO_R8uvMhE)

Listen carefully to the examples and jot down what you notice in terms of melody, chord, song structure, whatever.


# Synthesis vs Sampling

With Sonic Pi, it is also possible to change the synths as well as the sample sounds themselves which is really getting into the two different fields of **sound synthesis** and **sampling**. The former is generally about creating or rather synthesizing new sounds algorithmically with the help of a computer. The latter is about using, editing and modifying pre-recorded samples with the help of a computer in order to create new sounds. 

In Sonic Pi, synthesis and sampling is supported by changing the sound parameters of the sounds you load with the **play** and **sample** commands. 


## Audio Envelopes

One essential aspect of tweaking sounds in this context is the envelope of a sound as will be disucssed first.

attack, decay, sustain, release

## Synthesis Sound Parameters 

In order to improve the sound of the synths as well as the samples that you can load and playback with Sonic 

## Sampling Sound Parameters 



# FX
